Do not use structural types in normal use. They are a convenient and powerful feature, but unfortunately do not have an efficient implementation on the JVM. However — due to an implementation quirk — they provide a very nice shorthand for doing reflection.

    val obj: AnyRef

    obj.asInstanceOf[{def close()}].close()
