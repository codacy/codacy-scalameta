A consistent naming convention for field names can make code easier to read and understand.
You can parameterize the regex that validates your field names. The default regex is "^[a-z][A-Za-z0-9]*$".
There is also an option to specify if you want this pattern to check for enum variables (includeEnums), that are ignored by default.
